# WDI Project 3 - Flashcards

This is an app designed to let you test yourself with flashcards. It was built with a MERN stack.

## Process of Creating

I originally took inspiration from a flashcard app we were shown in class.

Like the one presented, a functionality was originally planned to cycle through flashcards randomly and allow one to remove flashcards that they had correct answers on.

Due to medical complications arising, this was not implemented. This instead functions like an app in which you can manipulate data. The functionality to run through flashcards may be implemented at a later date.

Another function originally planned was to be able to select an answer from a list of right/wrong answers to determine what to do with the card. Again, this was not implemented.
